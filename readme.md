# MacauGovApi

This project is created to automate gather Macau government data that is open for public use.
The project should gather all the links from the Macau government web page that we need to scrapy with, then get all the api links and stores them into local machines ( maybe change it to cloud base in the future )

### Version 2.0.0 (2023/09/20)
